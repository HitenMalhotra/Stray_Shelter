# Stray_Shelter
Developed a website for Animal rescuers and shelters using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap and JQuery as frameworks.

The website provides users a platform to share their real-life experiences of rescuing animals and seek help from local vets and animal shelters. Additionally, there is provision to maintain the medical history of stray animals rescued by them.
